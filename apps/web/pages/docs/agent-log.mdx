# Agent Development Log

This document tracks the AI-assisted development history of this portfolio project, including the system prompts, research methodologies, and custom tools used throughout the development process.

## Initial System Prompt (Eno Reyes Persona)

The project was initiated with a specialized AI persona designed to embody the principles of a Factory Reliability Engineer (FRE) with a focus on:

- **Measurable Results**: All changes must be quantifiable and verifiable
- **Standards Compliance (Pillar 8)**: Adherence to established coding standards and best practices
- **Comprehensive Observability (Pillar 6)**: Structured logging and monitoring across all features
- **Multi-Breakpoint Verification**: All UI/UX changes tested across mobile (320px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1280px)
- **Test-Driven Development**: New features paired with unit tests

### Core Persona Attributes

```
Role: Factory Reliability Engineer (FRE)
Focus Areas:
  - Performance Optimization (LCP, CLS, FID)
  - Security Best Practices
  - Observability & Monitoring
  - Responsive Design Standards
  - Version Control & Documentation
```

## Structured Research Prompts

The development process utilized XML-structured prompts to guide the AI model through complex, multi-phase implementations:

### Phase A: UI/UX Standards and Fluidity
```xml
<PHASE name="UI/UX Standards">
  <OBJECTIVE>Implement modern typography and responsive layout</OBJECTIVE>
  <ACTIONS>
    - Font Standard Implementation (Inter via next/font/google)
    - Responsive Layout Alignment (Tailwind breakpoints)
    - Content Alignment (optimal line length 50-75 chars)
  </ACTIONS>
  <VERIFICATION>
    - Visual testing across 3 breakpoints
    - Zero CLS with font optimization
  </VERIFICATION>
</PHASE>
```

### Phase B: Resume Hosting and Documentation
```xml
<PHASE name="Resume Infrastructure">
  <OBJECTIVE>Secure resume hosting with version tracking</OBJECTIVE>
  <ACTIONS>
    - Create /resume route with PDF viewer
    - Implement version utility (src/utils/resume-version.ts)
    - Add unit tests for version validation
  </ACTIONS>
  <VERIFICATION>
    - Version format validation (semantic versioning)
    - Unit test coverage
  </VERIFICATION>
</PHASE>
```

### Phase C: Analytics and Learning Dashboard
```xml
<PHASE name="Analytics Infrastructure">
  <OBJECTIVE>Multi-metric analytics dashboard</OBJECTIVE>
  <ACTIONS>
    - Analytics data collection endpoint
    - Instrumentation via structured logger
    - Visualization page with placeholder components
  </ACTIONS>
  <VERIFICATION>
    - Event tracking validation
    - Data payload structure documentation
  </VERIFICATION>
</PHASE>
```

## Custom Tools and Configurations

### 1. Structured Logger (`src/lib/logger.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized, context-aware logging for production observability
- **Features**:
  - Log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
  - Automatic context capture (timestamp, userAgent, URL)
  - Event tracking for analytics
  - Development vs. production behavior

### 2. Version Tracking Utility (`src/utils/resume-version.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized resume version management
- **Features**:
  - Semantic versioning validation
  - Formatted version strings
  - File path resolution
  - Unit test coverage

### 3. Analytics Instrumentation
- **Integration Points**:
  - ContactList component (link clicks)
  - Resume page (downloads, views)
  - Future: Page views, interaction metrics

## Development Milestones

### Milestone 1: Foundation (Initial Setup)
- Next.js 14 with App Router + Pages Router (Nextra docs)
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Vitest + React Testing Library (14/14 tests passing)
- Structured logging infrastructure

### Milestone 2: UI/UX Optimization
- Inter font implementation (zero CLS)
- Responsive layout refactoring
- Fluid typography across breakpoints
- Consistent spacing and padding

### Milestone 3: Resume Infrastructure
- Version-tracked resume hosting
- Secure PDF viewer at /resume
- Unit tests for version utility
- Download tracking via logger

### Milestone 4: Analytics Foundation
- Event tracking infrastructure
- Analytics page structure
- Component instrumentation
- Documentation for data integration

## Future Enhancements

### Planned: Learning Dashboard
A comprehensive learning progress tracker with:
- **Data Model**: LearningActivity, GoalProgress entities
- **Verification Gates**: Unit tests for progress calculations
- **Routing Strategy**: /dashboard, /dashboard/progress
- **Integration**: Structured logger for activity tracking

See `LEARNING_DASHBOARD_BLUEPRINT.mdx` for detailed architectural plan.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Structured Prompts**: XML-formatted prompts with clear phases improved AI comprehension and execution
2. **Incremental Development**: Breaking complex features into phases enabled better verification
3. **Test-First Approach**: Writing tests alongside features caught edge cases early
4. **Observability First**: Structured logging from day one simplified debugging and analytics
